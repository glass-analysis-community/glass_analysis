This directory contains a number of modules containing shared functionality
used by trajectory analysis scripts. Each module has a corresponding class
that is instantiated by the script that stores state corresponding to its
functionality and has a set of script options that it can process from the
command line.

The modules present are:

opentraj.py
  Module used for opening sets of trajectory files and runs with trajectory
  files. Consistency checks of the files are run and trajectory properties
  are compiled for later used.

progression.py
  Module used for generating sequences of numbers, usually used for
  sets of progressively increasing interval lengths of different types.

frame.py
  Module for getting particle position data from a set of frames in
  trajectory files. This module depends on one or multiple underlying
  trajectory file set objects provided by the opentraj module to read data
  from.

wcalc.py
  Module for calculating the w functions found in correlators from a set of
  particle position data. This module depends upon an underlying object
  provided by the frame module.

qshell.py
  Module for sorting and binning sets of quantities associated with an
  omnidirectional three-dimensional array of q vectors into quantities
  averaged by q vector magnitude. Two different regions of q vector magnitudes
  may be specified, one with averaging according to smaller discrete q vector
  magnitudes and another with averaging according to ranges of larger q vector
  magnitudes in onion shells. This module works particularly well for sorting
  the output of a three-dimensional fast Fourier transform.
